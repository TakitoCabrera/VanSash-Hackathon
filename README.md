Technologies used:
    - Express.js :: https://expressjs.com
    - Handlebars :: http://handlebarsjs.com
    - Chartist.js :: http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/getting-started.html
    - npm and node.js :: https://nodejs.org/en/

1) When you clone everything from the repo, open your command line and travel to the root folder for this project (VanSash-Hackathon)
    for mac is (cd ../../VanSash-Hackathon)

2) Once located in the root folder (Make sure node.js has been installed in your computer before you do this):
    $ npm install

    This will install all the dependencies to make this app work.

3) To open the test environment (with live updates) type:
    $ node bin/www

    You will see your command line running the app and the routers (don't stress about what this is) will start listening to your https port 3000

    Now you can go to your browser and open localhost:3000/

4) Use the "/views" folder to create partials if needed. I recommend you add your code to index.hbs (a partial is like a snipped of code that will
get added to layout.hbs aka index.html, dynamically, using handlebars).

I'LL ADD A TEST CHART IN ABOUT AN HOUR SO DON'T PANIC :) WE CAN BUILD UPON THE CHART IN A BIT

Info for me:
    - add, commit, push changes to my local branch
    - git merge with upstream/master
    - git pull request
    - git push
    The above should safely merge my fork with origin. So confusing using forks!
